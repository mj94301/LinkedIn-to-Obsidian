# LinkedIn Contacts to Markdown for Obsidian

This repository provides a Python script to convert your **LinkedIn connections download** into **Markdown files** formatted for use in **Obsidian**. The script structures each connection as an individual Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, enabling easy organization, linking, and visualization in Obsidian's **Graph View**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview of the Process

1. **Download Your LinkedIn Connections** from LinkedIn.
2. **Augment the Data in Excel** (Optional) â€“ Add job family categories or any other relevant metadata.
3. **Run the Python Script** â€“ Converts each contact into an individual Markdown file.
4. **Load Files into Obsidian** â€“ Create a tagging and linking structure to enhance Graph View visualization.

1. Go to **LinkedIn Settings & Privacy** â†’ **Data Privacy** â†’ **Get a copy of your data**.
2. Select **Connections** and request a download.
3. LinkedIn will create a CSV file you can download from that same page (`Connections.csv`).
4. Save the file and **rename it to** `LinkedIn_Connections_Download_YYYYMMDD.csv`.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Augment Data in Excel (Optional)

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Load into Obsidian and Create a Labeling Scheme

1. Open **Obsidian** and add `LinkedIn_Connections_MD` to your vault.
2. Use **Graph View** to visualize connections.
3. Establish an internal linking and tagging system:
   - Link contacts to **Companies**: `[[Company Name]]`
   - Categorize by **Job Family**: `[[Job Family]]`
   - Use **Tags** for filtering (e.g., `#networking`, `#consulting`)
   - Under Settings in Graph View use Groups to differentiate using colors
